    <b>Grand Theft Auto V</b>, developed by <b>Rockstar North</b> and released in <b><time datetime="2013-09-17">2013</time></b>, revolutionized open-world gaming with its groundbreaking technical achievements.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Built on the <b><abbr title="Rockstar Advanced Game Engine">RAGE</abbr></b> engine, the game features a meticulously crafted map of Los Santos and Blaine County, spanning over 49 square miles, and rendered with an unprecedented level of detail for its time. Dynamic lighting systems, high-resolution textures, and realistic weather patterns set a new benchmark for immersive environments.
</p>
<p>    
    The gameâ€™s physics engine allows for realistic vehicle handling, destructible objects, and lifelike character animations, making every interaction feel natural and dynamic.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Designed for longevity, <b>GTA V</b> supports resolutions up to 4K and 60 FPS on modern platforms such as the <b>PlayStation 5</b> and <b>PC</b>, along with advanced features like ray tracing and HDR, ensuring a visually stunning experience. Audio technology also plays a pivotal role, with over 20 hours of licensed music across multiple in-game radio stations and environmental soundscapes that enhance immersion.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, <b>GTA Online</b>, the multiplayer component, takes full advantage of these technical advancements, offering seamless online play with support for up to 30 players in a persistent, evolving world.

                Caption: The first trailer of GTA 5 from November 2011. The one-and-a-half-minute-long video features dynamically alternating scenes accompanied by the voice of a middle-aged man, as well as the sounds of the actions depicted on screen and background music. The full text spoken in the trailer:
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather, or the, I don't know... that thing, that magic, you see it in the movies. I wanted to retire from what I was doing, you know, from that, that line of work, be a good guy for once, a family man. So, I bought a big house, came here, put my feet up, thought I'd be a dad like all the other dads. My kids will be like the kids on TV, we play ball and sit in the sun, but, well, you know how it is."
            </p>
            <p>    
                <b>Scenes in order:</b>
            </p>
            <p>    
                At the beginning of the video, an ESRB age rating appears, labeled: "May contain content inappropriate for children."
                This is followed by a beach lifeguard/rental hut at sunset.
                A scene where men and women jog outdoors on a pier in the sunshine.
                The city is shown from afar in a bird's-eye view, with palm trees in the foreground and skyscrapers in the background. The caption "Rockstar Games presents" appears during this scene.
                A man hits a golf ball in a worm's-eye view, with a blue sky behind him.
                From another angle, we see him in a golf park on green grass, with trees in the background and skyscrapers visible in the distance.
                A man sits on an orange Jet-ski wearing a yellow life vest and drives under a bridge on the water.
                Two women and a man are seen from behind, looking up at a very tall mountain while wearing hiking gear.
                A red sports car stops at a crosswalk in the city, and its soft top closes via remote control. A woman crosses the street in front of the car.
                Wind turbines spin on hillsides between mountains. The text "A Rockstar North production" appears during this scene.
                On the terrace of a large house, a man and a woman are seen doing yoga from behind.
                A highway sign is shown close-up, reading: "NORTH â€“ 5 Los Puerta Fwy."
                An outdoor beach gym with palm trees in the background.
                A man in a green sweater and orange pants walks on a downtown street sidewalk, while a man in a white shirt standing by the curb stares at him.
                A close-up of the green-sweatered manâ€™s hand as he waves dismissively.
                A construction site with a red and yellow crane in the background, and a skyscraper under construction with an image of another skyscraper and the text: "Mile High Club."
                A middle-aged man in a gray suit seen from behind, directly in front of the camera, with skyscrapers and the city skyline in the background. He partially turns, and his profile becomes visible.
                A biplane flies low over a vineyard, spraying pesticide on the grapevines below, where workers cough from the spray.
                The same gray-suited man is now holding a machine gun, wearing a red jumpsuit and gas mask. He slams the side of a van labeled "Bugstars Pest Control," and two men dressed identically to him exit the back of the van, also holding machine guns, before kicking down a glass door.
                A blue convertible drives down a city asphalt road, with the gray-suited man seated in the car again.
                A truck passes in front of the frame, with a container crane structure visible in the background.
                On a roadside underpass sidewalk, a dozen homeless people are lined up, some sitting, some standing.
                A van is briefly visible, followed by a man hammering a "For Sale" sign into the ground in the front yard of a house.
                In front of a dilapidated liquor store, a woman in a miniskirt leans into a sports car, while another woman in a pink dress stands nearby. The store displays the word "Liquor" multiple times.
                A black sports car speeds past the camera, followed by a homeless man sitting on the curb. The sign he's holding reads: "Need money for beer, pot, and hookers. At least I ain't bullshittin'."
                A clutter of homeless peopleâ€™s belongings under an underpass, including tents, rags, old armchairs, and a woman in sweats.
                A fighter jet zooms through the sky between skyscrapers.
                A man wearing a vest is thrown out of a brightly lit nightclub onto the street. On the terrace outside, the sign "Tequi-la-la" is visible.
                Oil rigs pump on a hillside at sunset, with skyscrapers, palm trees, and roads visible in the background.
                A red sports car speeds past in a close-up shot, chased by a police car with sirens blaring. The red car crashes into a blue car.
                A tattooed man in a tank top runs through an alley, pursued by three police officers as a helicopter circles overhead.
                A burning car is shown in close-up.
                A hillside displays the "VINEWOOD" sign in huge letters, with a small plane flying above it.
                The plane is shown closer, with a large city in the hazy distance during sunrise/sunset.
                Finally, the text "GRAND THEFT AUTO" appears on the screen in white letters, followed by a green Roman numeral V with a ribbon reading "FIVE." The background fades to black, and the emblem disappears.

    <h3>The three protagonists of the game</h3>
    <p>
        Each protagonist in Grand Theft Auto V has a unique special ability. <br>
        Michael can slow down time during gunfights for precise shooting,<br>
        Franklin can slow down time while driving to make sharp maneuvers,<br>
        and Trevor deals extra damage while taking less, thanks to his "Rage" mode.
    </p>
    </section>
    </aside>
    <p>
        The game tells the intertwined stories of <b>Michael De Santa</b>, a retired bank robber seeking redemption; <b>Franklin Clinton</b>, an ambitious street hustler striving to escape his troubled past; and <b>Trevor Philips</b>, an unpredictable criminal whose chaotic behavior fuels much of the gameâ€™s intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each character brings a distinct personality and skill set, creating a narrative that is as diverse as it is compelling.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Together, they navigate personal struggles, complex relationships, and high-stakes heists in a sprawling city driven by greed, corruption, and betrayal. The dynamic interplay between their individual goals and shared missions forms the backbone of the story, weaving a tale of ambition and survival in the vibrant yet unforgiving world of Los Santos.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A groundbreaking feature of <b>Grand Theft Auto V</b> is the ability to switch between the three protagonists at almost any time, providing players with diverse perspectives and gameplay styles. This mechanic not only enriches the storytelling by offering multiple viewpoints but also adds strategic depth to missions. Players can seamlessly transition between Michaelâ€™s tactical precision, Franklinâ€™s expert driving, and Trevorâ€™s raw aggression, creating a fluid and engaging experience that adapts to different playstyles.<br>
